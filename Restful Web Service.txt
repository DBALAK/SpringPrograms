Restful Web Services:
-Solution to develop distributed application (old tech: CORBA,COM/DCOM,RMI)
2 types of web services:
1) SOAP 2) REST

Roy Fielding - author of HTTP protocol,Only HTTP protocol is enough to develop web service.
1) Resource- access it by URL  
SOA-Service Oriented Arch,
ROA-Resource Oriented Arch,design the application based on REST 
2) Uniform Methods - GET,POST,PUT,DELETE (business funcatinalty is achieved)
3) Stateless protocol  (Spring-Singleton)

Representational --  They support multiple reprsentation of data (reprsent data) Data format -- XML/JSON.
State - state keeps on changing time to time, state of system from one m/c to another m/c, eg. customer account details.
Transfer -- using HTTP protocol.

Need of data format:
Web based client - HTML,javascript (JSON)
B2B client - XML (validated easily)

JAX-RS,Spring API support (for JAX-RS support) - develop Restful web services

HATEOAS:
index.html--> login,welcome,contact.html (URL of home page is enough)
customer web service -- >  insurance details of customer 

   <customer>
      <name>hh</name>
	    <insurance>URL<insurance>
	  <age>67</age>
	</customer>
	
REST is a concept --- and JAX-RS is a framework
